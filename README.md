## TODO

### For Chinese

- [] re-rate the accuracy for DEOs (Hai, Jiahui, Yiwen)
- [] adjust the length of NPI contexts. Instead of commas, use maybe full stops
- [] corpus analysis/comparison of "any" and "renhe任何". How many are NPI; how many are free-choice items. 
- [] Chinese NPIs less productive than English NPIs in news text: e.g. 承想，起眼儿，好气儿
- [] Our results might be due to the possibility that the four well-known Chinese DEOs are too dominant: 无，不，未，没

### For the algorithm

- []check DLD09 implementation again
- []finish implementation of DLD10
- []implement [cheung12](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jcheung/papers/deo_eacl2012.pdf) (EACL)
